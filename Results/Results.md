_The below assumptions are made in scale with the magnitudes of $Re$ and $We$ tested._

When considering the Reynalds Number $(Re)$, we can conclude that the trends show that decreasing $Re$ by an order of magnitude visually **increases** the frequency of the bubble oscilation, and the amplitude of the dimensionless radius **decreases** throughout the oscilation. This is because in lowering $Re$ the viscous forces become more prominent, in turn they damp the system more. The opposite is shown in the high $Re$ where the inertial forces dominate and the bubble continues to oscilate. Hence, **we can see a trend in the bubbles evolution lasting longer with a higher $Re$**.

When considering the Weber Number $(We)$, we can conclude that the trends show that larger values of $We$ reduce the restoring force of the surface tension hence making the amplitude of the oscilations grow **larger** and more violent. Because the inertial forces dominate in a high $We$, we can also say that a higher $We$ can result in **more** oscilations. When this surface tension restoring force is high, the bubble does **not** oscilate very much as damps out quickly.

When considering these trends in addition to those above, we can conclude two things. One: with a **low** $Re$ and a **low** $We$, the bubble trends to collapse once and damp out quickly. Two: with a **high** $Re$ and a **high** $We$ the bubble ocilates many times before settling.
